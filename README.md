# k-Subsecting Recursive Feature Elimination

Source codes and experimental scripts for Bisecting and k-Subsecting
Recursive Elimination feaure selection methods. Benchmark datasets taken from
the scikit-feature selection repository (http://featureselection.asu.edu/).

Algorithms described in "Bisecting and k-Subsecting Recursive Feature 
Elimination" by Dariusz Brzezinski and Marcin Kowiel. Detailed experimental 
results available at: http://www.cs.put.poznan.pl/dbrzezinski/software/SRFE.html
